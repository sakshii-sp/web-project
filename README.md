## LearnLens AI

## Problem Statement
Students often struggle during learning because they don’t know what exactly to ask, cannot clearly identify where they are confused, and frequently lose focus due to fatigue or distraction. Traditional learning apps and AI tutors mainly provide information but fail to detect confusion in real time, guide students to frame correct questions, or adapt teaching based on the learner’s attention level. This leads to wasted study time, poor conceptual understanding, and low knowledge retention.

## Proposed Solution
**LearnLens AI** is an intelligent learning assistant designed to improve learning efficiency by combining AI-driven visualization, confusion detection, prompt guidance, and focus analysis.

---

## How It Works
1. The student starts learning a topic on LearnLens AI  
2. The system observes learning behavior such as mistakes, hesitation, and response patterns  
3. AI detects confusion points and unclear understanding in real time  
4. Student’s vague doubts are converted into clear and effective prompts  
5. Concepts are explained using visual diagrams and simplified explanations  
6. Eye-movement patterns are analyzed to detect focus level and fatigue  
7. Mini educational games are suggested to regain attention and engagement  
8. A personalized study plan is generated based on confusion areas, focus level, and performance
